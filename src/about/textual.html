commonly include the track of the vessel, list of personnel and ports of
 call, the expedition objective, and the scientific results of the 
expedition. Expeditions with multiple vessels were divided into cruises,
 with a cruise representing the track of each individual vessel. Lengthy
 cruises were divided into legs, which represented the work of the 
vessel between two points. When funding agencies no longer required 
expedition reports, some scientists continued the practice of writing 
these reports and others did not. In this project, Scripps expeditions, 
important for their contributions to geophysics, were selected and 
expedition reports for each of these specific expeditions have been 
selected. These expedition reports were used to select photographs, 
track charts, correspondence, cruise narratives, and other content that 
illustrate the expedition, scientists and work at sea.<br>
								<br>
								1,000 pages of expedition reports were scanned, OCR'd and 
encoded by <a href="http://www.spitech.com/">SPI Technologies</a>. For 
preservation purposes, each page (including the cover, the title page, 
back matter, and advertisements) was scanned at 600 dpi TIFF Group IV 
lossless compression and burned to CD-Rom media. The text was encoded in
 SGML using Level 4, TEI-Lite with 218 accompanying tables, graphs, and 
photographs embedded throughout as 300 dpi GIF images. The encoded text 
was checked for accuracy and consistency, parsed, and enhanced. The 
search and retrieval tool used to deliver the Expedition Reports is 
available through the Online Archive of California, OAC 2.5, using the 
DLXS software platform. As a result of this new platform, the SGML files
 have been converted to XML (full TEI).<br>

Department of Fish and Game's <i>Fish Bulletin</i> is a core resource 
for the study of fish and fisheries in California. Continuously 
published as a monographic series since 1913, the Fish Bulletin contains
 in-depth monographs on a variety of topics, primarily marine, and also 
including some non-fish marine species. Some Fish Bulletin titles are of
 specialized interest to scientists, state officials, and those with 
fishery management interests. Many <i>Fish Bulletin</i> titles however 
are of general public interest, constituting general works on marine 
species. These general interest titles cover marine fish (including 
specific titles on sardine, grunion, halibut, tuna, etc), sharks, sea 
lions, clams/mussels, abalone, squid, historical shore whaling, 
historical commercial fishing, etc. The <i>Fish Bulletin</i> is 
uncommonly held among California libraries, particularly in complete 
runs, and online access will greatly improve access to this resource.<br>
								<br>
								16,500 pages of the <i>Fish Bulletin</i> were scanned, OCR'd and
 encoded by <a href="http://www.spitech.com/">SPI Technologies</a> from 
the original source material. For preservation purposes, each page 
(including the cover, the title page, back matter, and advertisements) 
was scanned at 600 dpi TIFF Group IV lossless compression and burned to 
CD-Rom media. The text was encoded in SGML using Level 4, TEI-Lite with 
11,165 accompanying tables, graphs, and photographs embedded throughout 
as 300 dpi GIF images. The encoded text was checked for accuracy and 
consistency, parsed, and enhanced. The search and retrieval tool used to
 deliver the <i>Fish Bulletin</i> is available through the Online

							<td class="pagetext" colspan="4" valign="top">The<i> Fish 
Bulletin</i> also published an important collection of fish catch 
"landing" statistics for California. Published under various titles as <i>The
 commercial fish catch of California for the years..., The marine fish 
catch of California for the (years)...</i>, California marine fish catch
 for (year), and California marine fish landings for (year), these 
important statistics, covering the years 1916 through 1986, are not 
available online to the public, and provide a rich source of information
 for those who study the utilization and management of California 
fisheries.<br>
								<br>
								Over 3,000 pages of fish catch statistic tables were triple 
blind rekeyed by <a href="http://www.spitech.com/">SPI Technologies</a>.
 Locally, each table was photocopied and magnified for easier 
legibility. A master codebook and spreadsheet samples were created to 
describe the over forty various table types. Each table was assigned a 
specific table type, which included the bulletin number, the table 
number, the page number, and data elements from the original source. The
 master codebook, spreadsheet samples, and photocopied tables were 
delivered to PDCC and then returned as MS Excel spreadsheets. Data from 
the spreadsheets were closely examined for accuracy and consistency and a
 thesaurus of terms and a list of data available were then prepared. The
 spreadsheet data were converted into SAS data sets. Using tools the 
UCSD Libraries have developed for Web analysis of economic datasets, a 
user-friendly search and browse front end was developed for the SAS data
 sets so that users can locate, display, and graph data of interest 
and/or just download the data needed for use with statistical or 
spreadsheet software.<br>
								<br>
								The metadata for these datasets is marked up in XML using the 
Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) Document Type Defintion (DTD).</td>

								<br>
								Original typescripts of 52 oral history interviews, ranging in 
length from 3-68 leaves, were scanned in black-and-white at 200 dpi on 
an HP Scanjet 5370C. Automated OCR processing was performed with 
ScanSoft OmniPage Pro 11. The interviews were saved as MS Word 2000 
documents and encoded in HTML for Web presentation; and they were saved 
as ASCII text files and burned to CD-ROM media.<br>
