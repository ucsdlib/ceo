The Libraries, whose combined collections total over 2.9 million volumes, include the Art and Architecture Library, the Biomedical Library, the Center for Library and Instructional Computing Services, the Center for Magnetic Recording Research Library, the Film and Video Library, the International Relations and Pacific Studies Library, the Mandeville Special Collections Library, the Music Library, the Science and Engineering Library, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) Library (including the SIO Archives) and the Social Sciences and Humanities Library.    The Libraries serve as centers for study, reading and scholarship at UCSD.  Their collections and services provide essential resources in support of undergraduate and graduate instructional programs as well as advanced research, and the Libraries are now enhancing their value to the UCSD community by developing a comprehensive digital library program that will provide a powerful, useful, and exciting environment for access to digital information and knowledge. <br>

								The CEO website is designed to meet the needs of California's citizens for access to marine-related information.  We hope it will be a place where scientists and the public can begin their search for information on California's oceans.<br>

								<br>
								We welcome and encourage other marine-related institutions in California and in the San Diego museum community to add content to the site, thereby expanding its value.  Institutions may propose textual, audio, or visual resources relating to California's oceans and ocean exploration, and for which the institution holds copyright, for addition to the site.  Digital resources relating to a wide variety of topics, such as California fish and fisheries, marine resources, marine sciences, ocean sports, and marine expeditions, will enrich the value of this site.  <br>
								<br>
								Institutions must supply their own funds for resource digitization and/or technological enhancements to the site, but we welcome discussion of possible partnerships for locating financial support.<br>
								<br>
								Contact Peter Brueggeman, Director, SIO Library at (858) 534-1230 to discuss possibilities for adding content to CEO.<br>
